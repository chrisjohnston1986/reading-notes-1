# Wireframe and Design
Summarized from [Career Foundry](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/how-to-create-your-first-wireframe/)

## What is a Wireframe?
A wireframe is a bare-bones design for what will appear on a screen before building anything with code. It is a good way to visualize how everything is laid out on a page without the distractions of styling. Wireframes can be completed digitally or physically (paper and pencil or a whiteboard). Physical wireframes are easier to change before coding is under way, and to transfer to software later.

## Examples of Wireframes

## Steps to make a Wireframe

#### Do your research!
Before wireframing, understand your audience and analyze similar products

#### Prepare research for quick reference
Make a 'cheat sheet' with your requirements, and findings from your research.

#### Map your user flow
To limit your own (and your user's) frustration, map out the process of moving through information on a site.

#### Draft and Sketch
Start wireframing! This does not require fine detail, but should represent features and formats. Do not worry about aesthetics or colors, only function. Things to consider:
- Organize content to support user goals
- Consider which information should be most visible.
- What will the user *expect* to see on the page?
- What touch points does the user need to complete?
Share your wireframe with colleagues, and collaborate.

## Add detail and start testing
Add the skeleton of your site from top to bottom, left to right. Consider the placement of navigation and search tools, keep instructions simple, include tool tips if necessary.

## Turn Wireframes into prototypes
After receiving and utilizing feedback from testing, create your prototype, and continue testing.

### Tips on making a good Wireframe
- **Be clear.** What is this page for? What can the user do here?
- **Be confident.** Use familiar navigational processes, and place items in predictable places.
- **Simplicity.** Attractiveness is not a consideration for a wireframe. Keep it simple!

# Semantics
The term **semantics** refers to the meaning of a piece of code. What the code does, or what effect it has.

In HTML, a header is a semantic element. It emphasises the text inside of the header tags to appear as a header. Any text can be made to look this way by styling, but it will not function correctly without the proper semantics. "HTML should be coded to represent the data that will be populated and not based on its default presentation styling." CSS is for presentation.

### Some examples of semantic elements
In HTML, these will be represented as tags.

article, aside, details, footer, header, main, nav, section, summary, and MANY more.
