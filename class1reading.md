# Reading 01 Notes

## Markdown Basic Syntax

### Headings

- Headings are available in six different sizes, by utilizing the '#' symbol, with the largest using one symbol and the smallest using six.
- Always put a space between the symbol and the text for compatibility.

### Paragraphs

- Paragraphs are easy. You basically just type as you normally would.
- Do not indent for paragraphs. It can cause formatting issues.

### Line Breaks

- To break text into separate lines, the best way is to use two or more spaces.
- If you were taught to type sentences with two spaces at the end, use <br> instead.
- A backslash can also be used in some markup languages, but this is not recommended because it is not universal.

### Emphasis

- To emphasize by making text **bold**, use two asterisks or two underscores on either side of the text.
- If you need to make letters in the mi**dd**le of a word **bold**, use asterisks for compatibility.
- To emphasize by making text *italic*, use one asterisk or one underscore on either side of the text.
- If you need to make letters in the mi*dd*le of a word *italic*, use asterisks for compatibility.
