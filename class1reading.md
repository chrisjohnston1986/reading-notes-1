# Reading 01 Notes

## Markdown Basic Syntax

### Headings

- Headings are available in six different sizes, by utilizing the '#' symbol, with the largest using one symbol and the smallest using six.
- *For compatibility, always put a space between the symbol and the text.*

### Paragraphs

- Paragraphs are easy. You basically just type as you normally would.
- *To avoid formatting issues, do not indent paragraphs*

### Line Breaks

- To break text into separate lines, the best way is to use two or more spaces.
- If you were taught to type sentences with two spaces at the end, use <br> instead.
- *For compatibility, do not use a backslash*

### Emphasis

#### Bold
- To emphasize by making text **bold**, use two asterisks or two underscores on either side of the text.
- If you need to make letters in the mi**dd**le of a word **bold**, use asterisks for compatibility.

#### Italic
- To emphasize by making text *italic*, use one asterisk or one underscore on either side of the text.
- If you need to make letters in the mi*dd*le of a word *italic*, use asterisks for compatibility.

#### Bold and Italic
- To emphasize by making text **bold** and *italic*, use three asterisks or three underscores on either side of the text.
- If you need to make letters in the mi***ddd***le of a word ***bold and italic***, use asterisks for compatibility.

### Blockquotes
- To create a blockquote, add a 'greater than' > symbol in front of the text you wish to quote.
- If your quote has multiple paragraphs, use the > symbol on the blank lines between paragraphs.
- To nest a block quote within another block quote, use two 'greater than' symbols >>
- Other elements such as headings and ordered lists can be used within a block quote
- *For compatibility, put a blank line before and after block quotes*

### Lists

#### Ordered Lists
- To present items in an ordered list, add items on separate lines, preceded by a number and a period.
- Any number can be used, but the first number *must* be 1!
- *For compatibility, do not use parentheses for list items.*

#### Unordered Lists
- To present items in an unordered list, add items on separate lines, preceded by a dash '-', asterisk '*', or plus sign '+' 
#### Adding Elements in Lists
- Indent added elements by adding four spaces or one tab.
- To add **code blocks**, indent eight spaces or two tabs.
