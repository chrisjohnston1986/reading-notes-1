# HTML & CSS by Jon Duckett
*Summarized*

## Chapter 2: Text
p.40-61
- **Headings**: There are 6 levels of headings, `<h1>`-`<h6>`. `<h1>` is the largest.
- **Paragraphs**: Paragraphs are indicated with the `<p>` tag. Separate paragraphs with separate `<p>` tags. Do not indent.
- **Bold & Italic**: Surround text with a `<b>` tag to make it appear bold, and an `<i>` tag to make it appear italic.
- **Superscript & Subscript**: Use `<sup>` for superscript, and `<sub>` for subscript.
- **White Space**: Extra white space (2 or more spaces) are used to make code easier to read, but will be ignored by the browser
- **Line Breaks & Horizontal Rules**: To add a line break in the middle of a paragraph, use `<br />`. To add a horizontal rule between lines of text, use `<hr />`.

### Semantic Markup

- **Strong & Emphasis**: For strong emphasis in a text reader, use `<strong>`. For regular emphasis, use `<em>`.
- **Quotations**: Blockquotes(`<blockquote>`) is used for longer quotes that take up an entire paragraph. For shorter quotes that sit within a paragraph, use `<q>`.
- **Abbreviations & Acronyms**: For either abbreviations or acronyms, use `<abbr>`. A title attribute can be used to specify the full term.
- **Citations & Definitions**: To cite a source, use `<cite>` - the text will be italic. For a new term which is being defined, use `<dfn>`.
- **Author Details**: To contain contact details for the author of the page, use the `<address>` tag around the contact information.
- **Changes to Content**: The `<ins>` element can be used to show content that has been inserted into a document, while the `<del>` element can show text that has been deleted from it. The `<s>` element is used to display content that is no longer accurate, and will appear with a line through the text.
