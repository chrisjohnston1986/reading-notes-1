Summarized from:

## What is Version Control?
A Version Control is a system that allows the user to share code with others, for multiple developers to work on code simultaneously, review changes to code, and revert a file to a previous version.

## What is Git?
Git is a Distributed Version Control system (DVCS) which is made of of file "snapshots". It mostly uses local resources, not relying on a server or internet connection. Every chang that is made to a file is tracked by Git.

### Importing
To import an existing project or directory:
- Switch to target project's directory ***cd***
- Use ***git init*** command
- To start tracking these files
> ___git add *.c___   ***git add LICENSE***    ***git commit -m "add a message"***
