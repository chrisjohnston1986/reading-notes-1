# Programming with JavaScript

## Control Flow
Summarized from [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Control_flow)

>The *control flow* is the order in which the computer executes statememts in a script.

Generally, code executes from top to bottom unless the code encounters a structure that changes the control flow, such as a conditional or a loop.

**Reminder**: conditional structures include `if`...`else`

## JavaScript Functions
Summarized from [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp)

>A function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. A JS function is executed when "something" calls it.

For example:

> `function myFunction(p1, p2) {`
  `return p1 * p2;   // The function returns the product of p1 and p2`
`}`

## JavaScript Function Syntax
JS functions are defined with the `function` keyword, followed by a name (you choose the name), followed by parentheses `()`. Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and `$` signs. Parentheses *may* include parameter names separated by commas:
`(parameter1,parameter2)`. The code to be executed by the function is placed inside curly brackets.

Function **arguments** are the values received by the function when it is invoked.

In other programming languages, **function** is much the same as **procedure** or **subroutine**
