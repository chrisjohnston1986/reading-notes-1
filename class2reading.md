# The Coder's Computer
## Text Editors
A text editor is a piece of software downloaded to a computer or accessed online that allows the user to write and manage text, and to create websites. Choosing the correct text editor is specific to the coder and their wants and needs. 

### Included with your computer
Text editors that are pre-installed on computers, such as Notepad, are very basic and typically do not include features that make writing code most efficient.
### Third-Party options
These text editors contain additional features such as syntax highlighting, code completion, word completion, function completion, shorthand for HTML and CSS, themes, extensions, and more. Some options for Windows include Notepad++, BB Edit, Virtual Studio Code, Atom, Brackets, and Sublime Text. 

## The Command Line
[Linux Tutorial](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/commandline.php)

The *command line* is also known as *the terminal* - a text-based interface to the system.
The *shell* that is within the terminal defines how the terminal behaves and executes commands.

## Basic Navigation

>**pwd**:  Present Working Directory
>**ls**:  Lists  
>**cd**:  Change Directory

Shortcuts:
>**~** :  To home directory  
>**.** :  To current directory  
>**..** :  To parent directory  
> **Tab key** :  Auto-complete, tab again to scroll through options  
> **Up/Down Arrow keys** :  Scroll through recent commands

## Files
[Linux Tutorial](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/aboutfiles.php)

Everything in Linux is a file. There are no extensions (.png, .pdf, etc.), but the **file** command can give information about what type a file is. A "path" is just a way to get to a file.

Linux is *case sensitive*. Type exactly what you mean!

Don't use spaces when specifying a file name - use single quotations or escape characters instead. **Tab key** will do this automatically.

### Hidden Files

Hidden files begin with a full stop (.)
Files which are hidden will not appear with command **ls** alone. To view hidden files, include **-a**
> **ls -a**  is used to view hidden files

Files may be renamed with or without a full stop to hide or unhide them respectively.
