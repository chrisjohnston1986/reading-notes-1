# The Coder's Computer
## Text Editors
A text editor is a piece of software downloaded to a computer or accessed online that allows the user to write and manage text, and to create websites. Choosing the correct text editor is specific to the coder and their wants and needs. 

### Included with your computer
Text editors that are pre-installed on computers, such as Notepad, are very basic and typically do not include features that make writing code most efficient.
### Third-Party options
These text editors contain additional features such as syntax highlighting, code completion, word completion, function completion, shorthand for HTML and CSS, themes, extensions, and more. Some options for Windows include Notepad++, BB Edit, Virtual Studio Code, Atom, Brackets, and Sublime Text.
