## [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)
*from Wikipedia*

"Minimum Viable Product"

> A minimum viable product has just enough core features to effectively deploy the product, and no more. 

Purposes of MVP:
- Test a product hypothesis with minimal resources
- Accelerate learning
- Reduce wasted engineering hours
- Get the product to early customers as soon as possible
- Find a base for other products
- Establish a builder's abilities in crafting the product required
- Build a brand very quickly
