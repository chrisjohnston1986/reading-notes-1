# Growth Mindset

## Upgrading Technical Skills

Upgrading technical skills throughout your tech career comes from a constant, deliberate effort to identify areas of weakness and practice. You don't need to build a full-stack application to practice isolated skills. Just like music, "playing" (building a full application) and "practice" (breaking that app down into small parts to focus on), are not the same, and do not yield the same results. 

Find coding challenges and exercises to practice regularly to keep your skills sharp and upgraded such as

## Redifining Success

It is important to remember that although extreme success and wealth is constantly portrayed in media as being something obtainable purely by hard work and dedication, society does not currently lend itself to allowing *just anyone* to obtain those goals.

It is also important to rembmer that it is not possible to be successful at everything. There will always be some area of loss for every area of success. 

How do I define my own success?
- Constantly learning and implementing new things
- Feeling a sense of achievement and satisfaction in my work
- Making enough money to live comfortably
- Having a career that affords me time with my friends and family, and offers me peace of mind
