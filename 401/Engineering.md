Remember that it is OKAY to say 'no' to being *busy*. I am the only one who is in charge of my time. Be sure to work with as much focus as possible. Treat your time like it is your most valuable resource, because it is!

[Solving Problems](https://simpleprogrammer.com/solving-problems-breaking-it-down/)

One of the most common mistakes in interviews is trying to start coding too early. Spend time to fully understand the problem and map out a solution.

1. Read the problem completely twice. (THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP!!)
2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
3. Optimize the manual steps.
4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
5. Replace the comments/pseudo-code with real code.
6. Optimize the real code.

> Problem solving is the meta-skill.

The best way to solve a problem involves having a framework and practicing that framework. 

Steps to problem-solving:
1. Understand the problem. Be sure that you can explain it in plain English. Write the problem down, draw an diagram, or explain the problem to someone else.
2. Plan. Give yourself time to analyze the problem - don't dive right into coding. Answer the question "Given input x, what are the steps necessary to return output y?"
3. Divide. Break your problem into smaller sub-problems, and solve them one-by-one. Begin with the simplest, work your way through, then connect the dots.
  > "Do not try to solve one big problem. You will cry."
4. Stuck? Getting stuck happens to everyone. Debug step-by-step. Reassess from a different perspective (maybe even start over!). Research a solution to the sub-problem.
5. Practice. Games are a great way to do this. Check out [Coderbyte](https://coderbyte.com/) for daily challenges.

[The 5 Whys](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_5W.htm)

Identify the problem you are trying to solve. In order to get to the true root of the problem, ask the question "Why?" five times. You'll know when you have the root of the problem when the question "Why?" no longer produces a useful response.

[The Super Mario Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vJRopau0g0)

When people are penalized for failure, they are more likely to give up and feel poorly about themselves. Failure is part of the learning process. Even though you WILL fail at tasks, remember your failures and find something to learn from them. Meaningful things in life will involve failures, but life would be boring without having the ability to overcome those failures.


### Discussion Questions

- What's the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

  *No one else can bring my specific set of skills and experiences to a career. I will bring all of the knowledge that I have gained from my previous career as a teacher, especially my leadership, communication, and ability to connect with people.*

- What are 3 things I'll start doing to "un-stick" myself whenever I get stuck on a tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

  *I will take a break and walk away from the code to refresh my mind. I will be sure that I have written out my sub-problems, and that I have a solution for them first. And I will ask another dev to look at my code to see if there is something obvious I am missing.*
