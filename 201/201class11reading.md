# Chapter 16: Images
p.406-427

## Sizing

Images can be sized by specifying the `width` and `height` using pixels, or by being given a name such as `small`, `medium`, `large`, etc.

## Alignment and Centering

Images can be aligned using the `float` property, or specifying a left or right alignment.

By default, images flow within the surrounding text.
To center, use `display: block` with `margin: auto` or `text-align: center` the surrounding text.

## Background Images

To add a background image in place of a color, use `background-image`. Background images will automatically repeat to fill the space. `repeat-x` will make the image repeat only horizontally, and `repeat-y` will do the same vertically. `no-repeat` will prevent the image from repeating at all. When a background image is not being repeated, `background-position`  can be used to specify where in the browser window the background image should be placed.

The gradient and contrast of background images can also be adjusted (p.419-420)

# Chapter 9: Flash (outdated, but important to know)
p.201-206

From about 1990-2005, Flash was a very popular tool for creating animations, and for playing audio and video in websites. 

Flash files are saved with the `.fla` file extension; to be used on the web, they are saved with the `.swf` file extension.
