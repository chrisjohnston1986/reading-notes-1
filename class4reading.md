# Wireframe and Design
Summarized from [Career Foundry](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/how-to-create-your-first-wireframe/)
## What is a Wireframe?
A wireframe is a bare-bones design for what will appear on a screen before building anything with code. It is a good way to visualize how everything is laid out on a page without the distractions of styling. Wireframes can be completed digitally or physically (paper and pencil or a whiteboard). Physical wireframes are easier to change before coding is under way, and to transfer to software later.
