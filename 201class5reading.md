## Chapter 5: Images
p.94-125

Images are added with the `<img>` tag. The `<img>` tag is an empty element, and does not need a closing tag, but must have the following attributes: `src` (source - usually a URL), `alt` (provides a text description of the image), and `title` (provides additional information, shows when the user hovers over the image).

Height and width may be specified inside the image tag using pixels.

Three rules for creating images: 
1. Save images in the correct format (jpeg, gif, or png)
2. Save images at the correct size.
3. Measure images in pixels.

SVG images are resolution-independent and typically used for logos.


## Chapter 11: Color
p. 246-263

Colors on a computer screen are created by mixiing amounts of red, green, and blue. Some colors are available in CSS by typing in their name, for others, use RGB values, Hex code, HSL/HSLA, or an online color picker.

The opacity of objects can be changed by giving them a value between 0 and 1. as a percentage of the opacity. 0.1 = 10% opacity.

## Chapter 12: Text
p.264-299

### Typeface

- Serif: have extra details on the ends of the main strokes of the letters. Used for reading large blocks of text.
- Sans-serif: straight ends to letters, providing a cleaner design.
- Monospace: every letter is the same width
- Cursive: made to look more like handwritten styles.
- Fantasy: decorative, used most often for titles.

Changes to the style of text should be made in CSS, not HTML.

Text can be styled with the following properties: bold, italic, text-transform, text-decoration (underline, overline, line-through, blink), line-height, letter spacing, word spacing, text align, vertical align, text indent, text shadow, first letter or line, links (visited and not visited), user response (hover, active, focus).
