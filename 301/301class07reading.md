# REST

## [How I explained REST to my brother](https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)

**Who is Roy Fielding?**

Roy Fielding helped write the first web servers, and did "a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does".

**Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?**

They were not designed to be used that way. They were designed to talk to a small group of machines.

**What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?**

It is all about "applying verbs to nouns". Web browsers basically only 'get' things using URLs.

**What does a GET do?**

When a machine 'gets' a resource, it is asking for a machine-readable version of that information. Browsers 'get' human-readable versions. GET *retrieves* information.

**What does a POST do?**

POST *adds* information to a system

**What does PUT do?**

PUT *replaces* information in a system

**What does PATCH do?**

PATCH *partially updates* information in a system
